# TX-Legacy
Custom ESX Framework 
TX-Legacy is a custom ESX framework. It restores the getSharedObject function by also using the new import/export system. It was designed because of 
older resources that use the old method have to be converted which can break. Some of those resources are no longer updated. With this custom 
framework you can contune to use your old resources with any new resources you have have. This framework is using OX resources to handle inventory among
other things.
